**I am looking for motivated and skilled students interested in conducting research in software engineering! Please contact me with your CV if you are interested!**

Hi there! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/?svr=web){:target="_blank"} at the [College of William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests are in software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, code refactoring, code quality, developer's productivity, and text analysis applied to software engineering.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Software Engineering from [The University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2019, under the advice of Dr. [Andrian Marcus](http://www.utdallas.edu/~amarcus/){:target="_blank"}. I obtained my B.Eng. and M.Eng. in Systems Engineering and Computing from [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://bogota.unal.edu.co/){:target="_blank"} in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia.

My current research aims at improving the quality of bug reports written by end users and assisting software developers during bug
triage and resolution. 

Specifically, my research focuses on identifying, verifying, and analyzing the textual information of bug reports, by adapting and integrating techniques from software analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning, to improve how users report and how developers triage and solve software bugs. 

Take a look at my [publications](publications/) to know more about my research.
