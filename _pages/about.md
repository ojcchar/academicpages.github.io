Hi there! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/?svr=web){:target="_blank"} at the [College of William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests are in software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, code refactoring, code quality, developer's productivity, and text analysis applied to software engineering.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Software Engineering from [The University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2019, under the advice of Dr. [Andrian Marcus](http://www.utdallas.edu/~amarcus/){:target="_blank"}. I obtained my B.Eng. and M.Eng. in Systems Engineering and Computing from [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://bogota.unal.edu.co/){:target="_blank"} in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia.

My current research aims at improving the quality of bug reports written by end users and assisting software developers during bug
triage and resolution. 

Specifically, my research focuses on identifying, verifying, and analyzing the textual information of bug reports, by adapting and integrating techniques from software analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning, to improve how users report and how developers triage and solve software bugs. 

Take a look at my [publications](publications/) to know more about my research.

***IMPORTANT ADS:*** 

**I am looking for motivated and skilled students (undergraduate and graduate) interested in software engineering (SE) research!**

**If you are not a student at W&M, consider applying to the [CS graduate program](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/graduate/admission/index.php){:target="_blank"} (Deadline for Fall: March 1st/15th).**

**Feel free to send me an email with your CV and your interest in my research and in SE.**
